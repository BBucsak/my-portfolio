    		<h3> About Me </h3>
    		<p>I currently reside in Carteret, New Jersey. I am a verteran of the United States Air Force. I served six years as a Security Forces Specialist before entering the wonderful world of retail. After working numerous years in retail I made the move over to the operations side of things as a Distribution Supervisor of a warehouse where I have been working for the last nine years. Then came a time in my life where I wanted to spend more of my time enjoying everything life has to offer.</p>

    		<p> I started wanting to travel more but with limited vacation time that became difficult to do. So I was doing research on what I could do to work for myself and I found that coding was very intriguing to me. I not only enjoy working for myself but I enjoy having the ability to help small companies grow into succesful ones with a nice designed website. I also like to give back to the veterans that are trying to get their own business up and running.</p>
